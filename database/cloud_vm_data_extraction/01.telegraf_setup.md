# Step 1: Install Telegraf on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS

Open a terminal and SSH into your deployed Ubuntu server.

Update Package Lists: Ensure your system's package lists are up-to-date:

Bash
    sudo apt update
    
Install Telegraf: Use the apt package manager to install Telegraf:

Bash
    sudo apt install telegraf

This command will download and install the Telegraf package from the default Ubuntu repositories.

Verify Installation (Optional): You can check if Telegraf is installed and its version:

Bash
    telegraf --version

My version installed (for the record): Telegraf 1.21.4+ds1-0ubuntu2

# Step 2: Configure Telegraf on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS

The main Telegraf configuration file is located at /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf. You'll need to edit this file with sudo nano:

Bash
    sudo nano /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf

Review [agent] Settings: Examine the [agent] section for global configuration options. You can usually keep the defaults for the interval (10s) and hostname.

Enable Input Plugins ([[inputs.*]]): Uncomment and configure the input plugins to collect the metrics you need. Find the corresponding sections and make the following adjustments (at a minimum):

[[inputs.cpu]]: Uncomment this section. The default settings are generally sufficient to get overall and per-CPU usage.

[[inputs.mem]]: Uncomment this section. The defaults will collect memory usage statistics.

[[inputs.disk]]: Uncomment this section. Modify the ignore_fs line to exclude temporary and virtual file systems:

Ini, TOML
    [[inputs.disk]]
    ignore_fs = ["tmpfs", "devtmpfs", "devfs", "iso9660", "overlay", "aufs", "squashfs"]

- Explanation of the File System Types:
    - tmpfs: A temporary file system backed by RAM and/or swap.
    - devtmpfs: A file system that manages device files in /dev.
    - devfs: (Older systems) Another file system for device files, largely superseded by devtmpfs.
    - iso9660: The standard file system for CD-ROM media.
    - overlay: A file system that combines multiple directory trees into a single view (often used with containers).
    - aufs: Another union file system (like overlayfs).
    - squashfs: A compressed read-only file system.

<!-- Continue from here. Need to open up nano again, saving and closing it for now.-->
[[inputs.diskio]]: Uncomment this section. You can optionally specify specific devices to monitor using the devices option if you don't want all of them.

Ini, TOML
    [[inputs.diskio]]
    # devices = ["sda", "vda"] # Uncomment and list specific devices

[[inputs.net]]: Uncomment this section. You can optionally specify the network interfaces you want to monitor using the interfaces option (e.g., eth0, ens*).

Ini, TOML
    [[inputs.net]]
    # interfaces = ["eth0", "ens*"] # Uncomment and list specific interfaces

[[inputs.system]]: Uncomment this section. It collects system-wide information like uptime and load averages.

Configure Output Plugin ([[outputs.postgresql]]): Add the following section at the end of the telegraf.conf file to configure the PostgreSQL output:

Ini, TOML

[[outputs.postgresql]]
  host = "<your_cloud_db_endpoint>"
  port = 5432
  database = "<your_database_name>"
  user = "<your_db_username>"
  password = "<your_db_password>"
  sslmode = "require" # Or "disable" if SSL is not configured

  ## Default table for metrics
  table = "metrics"

  ## How are tags and fields stored
  tag_columns = ["host"]
  field_columns = ["usage_user", "usage_system", "usage_idle", "used", "free", "read_count", "write_count", "read_bytes", "write_bytes", "bytes_sent", "bytes_recv", "uptime"]

  ## Timestamp configuration
  timestamp_column = "timestamp"
  timestamp_format = "timestamp"
Remember to replace the <placeholders> with your actual cloud PostgreSQL connection details. The field_columns list is a starting point based on common metrics. You might need to adjust this later based on the exact fields Telegraf provides and the columns in your Metrics table.

Save and Close the Configuration File: Press Ctrl+X, then Y to confirm saving, and then Enter.

# Step 3: Start and Enable Telegraf on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS

Start the Telegraf service:

Bash

sudo systemctl start telegraf
Enable Telegraf to start on boot:

Bash

sudo systemctl enable telegraf
Check the Status of Telegraf: Verify that Telegraf is running without errors:

Bash

sudo systemctl status telegraf
Look for lines indicating that the service is active (running). If there are errors, examine the output for clues about configuration issues. You can also check the Telegraf logs using journalctl -u telegraf.

Next Steps:

After completing these steps, Telegraf should be running on your Ubuntu server and sending metric data to the metrics table in your cloud PostgreSQL database. Your next actions will be:

Verify Data in PostgreSQL: Connect to your cloud database using DBeaver or psql and query the metrics table to see if data is being inserted.
Adjust Table Schema: If the columns in the metrics table don't perfectly align with the data Telegraf is sending, you'll need to alter the table schema accordingly.
Refine Telegraf Configuration: Explore the specific fields available in the Telegraf input plugins you've enabled and adjust the field_columns in the postgresql output plugin to capture the metrics you need.
Address Specific Metrics: Investigate how to collect metrics like latency_in_ms, db_queries_per_sec, and error_count using Telegraf or supplementary methods.
This tailored guide should get Telegraf running on your Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS server and sending data to your PostgreSQL database. Let me know if you encounter any issues during this setup!
