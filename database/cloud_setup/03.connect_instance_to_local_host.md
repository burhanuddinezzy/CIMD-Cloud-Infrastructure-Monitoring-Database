# Connecting to Oracle Cloud Compute Instance via SSH (PostgreSQL Server Setup)

After creating the cloud instance, the following steps were required to successfully connect to it and prepare it for database server hosting:

---

## 1. SSH Key Pair (During Instance Creation)

- During creation, I was prompted to upload a public SSH key.
- I generated a key pair using a local tool (e.g., Git Bash or PuTTYgen).
- Uploaded the `.pub` file when prompted.
- Saved the private key as:  
  `C:\Users\burha\.ssh\cimd_postgresql_key`

---

## 2. Initial SSH Connection Failed

Attempted to connect:

```bash
ssh -i "/c/Users/burha/.ssh/cimd_postgresql_key" ubuntu@<public_ip>
```

**Got this error:**

```
ssh: connect to host <public_ip> port 22: Connection timed out
```

---

## 3. Fixes Required (Network and Security)

### a. Add Ingress Rule for Port 22 (SSH)

- Go to **VCN > Security Lists > Ingress Rules**
- Add rule:
  - **Source CIDR:** `0.0.0.0/0`
  - **Protocol:** TCP
  - **Destination Port Range:** 22
  - **Stateless:** No

> *Note: Initially entered 22 in source port by mistake — it must be in destination port.*

### b. Setup Internet Gateway and Route Rule

- Created an Internet Gateway under VCN
- Route table → Add Route Rule:
  - **Target Type:** Internet Gateway
  - **Destination CIDR:** `0.0.0.0/0`

### c. Verify VNIC and Subnet

- Go to **Instance > Attached VNICs**
- Check:
  - Public IP is assigned (Ephemeral)
  - Subnet is public
  - VNIC is attached and active

---

## 4. Notes

- Ping does not work (ICMP blocked by default), but SSH still works.
- If the instance is restarted, a new ephemeral public IP may be assigned.
- Consider reserving a static public IP if needed.
- On Unix systems, set private key permissions:

```bash
chmod 400 cimd_postgresql_key
```

---

## 5. Final SSH Command (Successful)

Once everything was fixed, SSH succeeded with:

```bash
ssh -i "/c/Users/burha/.ssh/cimd_postgresql_key" ubuntu@<public_ip>
```

# PostgreSQL Connection Issue: TcpTestSucceeded: False (Port 5432 Blocked)

## Problem Summary

While testing external connectivity to the Oracle Cloud PostgreSQL server using:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <PUBLIC_IP> -Port 5432
```

You may encounter this issue:

```
PingSucceeded : True
TcpTestSucceeded : False
```

Even though:

- PostgreSQL is properly installed and configured on the cloud VM
- Port 5432 is open in the Oracle Cloud security list
- `postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf` are correctly configured

This indicates that the problem lies not on the server, but on the local machine or network.

---

## Root Cause

Outbound traffic from the local machine or network is blocking port 5432.

This can be caused by:

- Windows Defender Firewall blocking outbound traffic
- Router or ISP restrictions on non-standard ports like 5432

---

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Allow PostgreSQL Port (5432) in Windows Firewall

1. Open **Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall**
2. Go to **Advanced Settings**
3. Under **Outbound Rules**, click **New Rule**
4. **Rule Type:** Port
5. **Protocol:** TCP
6. **Port:** 5432
7. **Action:** Allow
8. **Profile:** Private & Public
9. **Name:** Allow PostgreSQL Outbound
10. Save and apply the rule

Re-run the test:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <PUBLIC_IP> -Port 5432
```

You should now see:

```
TcpTestSucceeded : True
```

---

### Option 2: Try a Different Network

If you're on a restricted corporate or school Wi-Fi, try:

- A different Wi-Fi network
- A mobile hotspot
- A VPN that does not block outbound traffic

---

### Option 3: Use an SSH Tunnel as a Workaround

If port 5432 is blocked and cannot be opened, you can tunnel PostgreSQL traffic through port 22 (SSH):

**Command (Linux/macOS/Git Bash on Windows):**

```bash
ssh -L 5432:localhost:5432 ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP>
```

This lets you connect to `localhost:5432` in tools like pgAdmin or DBeaver, which gets forwarded to the remote VM.

---

## Final Check

Once fixed, verify with:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <PUBLIC_IP> -Port 5432
```

If `TcpTestSucceeded` returns `True`, external PostgreSQL access is now working.

# Secure Remote Access to PostgreSQL (When Direct Port Access Fails)

Direct access to the PostgreSQL port (5432) over the internet was not successful due to one or more of the following reasons:

- Cloud firewall restrictions or public IP routing rules.
- ISP or OS-level blocking of the port.
- Oracle Cloud's security model prioritizing SSH access over open database ports.

---

## Solution: SSH Tunnel for PostgreSQL Access

To securely connect to the remote PostgreSQL database from a local machine, I set up an SSH tunnel that forwards a local port (15432) to the remote PostgreSQL port (5432).

### Steps Taken

1. **Verified failure of direct connection:**

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 40.233.74.182 -Port 5432
    # Result: TcpTestSucceeded : False
    ```

2. **Used SSH tunneling to forward local port 15432 to remote 5432:**

    ```powershell
    ssh -i "C:\Users\burha\.ssh\cimd_postgresql_key" -L 15432:localhost:5432 ubuntu@40.233.74.182
    ```
    - `-i`: Specifies the private key for SSH authentication.
    - `-L`: Establishes a tunnel: local_port:remote_host:remote_port.

3. **Confirmed tunnel was active locally:**

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 127.0.0.1 -Port 15432
    # Result: TcpTestSucceeded : True
    ```

4. **Connected using a PostgreSQL client with the following settings:**

    | Setting   | Value                    |
    |-----------|--------------------------|
    | Host      | 127.0.0.1                |
    | Port      | 15432                    |
    | Username  | (your PostgreSQL user)   |
    | Password  | (your PostgreSQL password) (**You may have to update the password in case pw authentication fails when trying to connect**) |
    | Database  | (your database name)     |

---

## Outcome

PostgreSQL is now securely accessible from the local machine through SSH tunneling without needing to expose port 5432 over the public internet.
