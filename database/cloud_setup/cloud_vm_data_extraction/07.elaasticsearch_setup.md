<!--Just yesterday, I learnt that using a reltional database managmeent system isnt the best choice for managing application logs and a time series databases exist for this reason. So, I will now create a separate database to collect application logs. I will be using elasticsearch server engine, and for data visualization, I will primairly use Grafana for system level metrics, and then use Tableau/PowerBI for business level metrics-->
