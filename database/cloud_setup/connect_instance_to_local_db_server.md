Connecting to Oracle Cloud Compute Instance via SSH (PostgreSQL Server Setup)
After creating the cloud instance, the following steps were required to successfully connect to it and prepare it for database server hosting:

1. SSH Key Pair (During Instance Creation)
   During creation, I was prompted to upload a public SSH key.

I generated a key pair using a local tool (e.g., Git Bash or PuTTYgen).

Uploaded the .pub file when prompted.

Saved the private key as:
C:\Users\burha\.ssh\cimd_postgresql_key

2. Initial SSH Connection Failed
   Attempted to connect:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -i "/c/Users/burha/.ssh/cimd_postgresql_key" ubuntu@<public_ip>
Got this error:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
ssh: connect to host <public_ip> port 22: Connection timed out 3. Fixes Required (Network and Security)
a. Add Ingress Rule for Port 22 (SSH)
Go to VCN > Security Lists > Ingress Rules

Add rule:

Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0

Protocol: TCP

Destination Port Range: 22

Stateless: No

Note: Initially entered 22 in source port by mistake ‚Äî it must be in destination port.

b. Setup Internet Gateway and Route Rule
Created an Internet Gateway under VCN

Route table ‚Üí Add Route Rule:

Target Type: Internet Gateway

Destination CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0

c. Verify VNIC and Subnet
Go to Instance > Attached VNICs

Check:

Public IP is assigned (Ephemeral)

Subnet is public

VNIC is attached and active

4. Notes
   Ping does not work (ICMP blocked by default), but SSH still works.

If the instance is restarted, a new ephemeral public IP may be assigned.

Consider reserving a static public IP if needed.

On Unix systems, set private key permissions:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod 400 cimd_postgresql_key 5. Final SSH Command (Successful)
Once everything was fixed, SSH succeeded with:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -i "/c/Users/burha/.ssh/cimd_postgresql_key" ubuntu@<public_ip>

‚ùó PostgreSQL Connection Issue: TcpTestSucceeded: False (Port 5432 Blocked)
‚úÖ Problem Summary
While testing external connectivity to the Oracle Cloud PostgreSQL server using:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <PUBLIC_IP> -Port 5432
You may encounter this issue:

powershell
Copy
Edit
PingSucceeded          : True
TcpTestSucceeded       : False
Even though:

PostgreSQL is properly installed and configured on the cloud VM

Port 5432 is open in the Oracle Cloud security list

postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf are correctly configured

This indicates that the problem lies not on the server, but on the local machine or network.

üîç Root Cause
Outbound traffic from the local machine or network is blocking port 5432.

This can be caused by:

Windows Defender Firewall blocking outbound traffic

Router or ISP restrictions on non-standard ports like 5432

üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix
‚úÖ Option 1: Allow PostgreSQL Port (5432) in Windows Firewall
Open Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall

Go to Advanced Settings

Under Outbound Rules, click New Rule

Rule Type: Port

Protocol: TCP

Port: 5432

Action: Allow

Profile: Private & Public

Name: Allow PostgreSQL Outbound

Save and apply the rule

Re-run the test:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <PUBLIC_IP> -Port 5432
You should now see:

powershell
Copy
Edit
TcpTestSucceeded : True
‚öôÔ∏è Option 2: Try a Different Network
If you're on a restricted corporate or school Wi-Fi, try:

A different Wi-Fi network

A mobile hotspot

A VPN that does not block outbound traffic

üîê Option 3: Use an SSH Tunnel as a Workaround
If port 5432 is blocked and cannot be opened, you can tunnel PostgreSQL traffic through port 22 (SSH):

Command (Linux/macOS/Git Bash on Windows):

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -L 5432:localhost:5432 ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP>
This lets you connect to localhost:5432 in tools like pgAdmin or DBeaver, which gets forwarded to the remote VM.

‚úÖ Final Check
Once fixed, verify with:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <PUBLIC_IP> -Port 5432
If TcpTestSucceeded returns True, external PostgreSQL access is now working.

_____________________________________
üîí Secure Remote Access to PostgreSQL (When Direct Port Access Fails)
Direct access to the PostgreSQL port (5432) over the internet was not successful due to one or more of the following reasons:

Cloud firewall restrictions or public IP routing rules.

ISP or OS-level blocking of the port.

Oracle Cloud's security model prioritizing SSH access over open database ports.

‚úÖ Solution: SSH Tunnel for PostgreSQL Access
To securely connect to the remote PostgreSQL database from a local machine, I set up an SSH tunnel that forwards a local port (15432) to the remote PostgreSQL port (5432).

Steps Taken
Verified failure of direct connection:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 40.233.74.182 -Port 5432
# Result: TcpTestSucceeded : False
Used SSH tunneling to forward local port 15432 to remote 5432:

powershell
Copy
Edit
ssh -i "C:\Users\burha\.ssh\cimd_postgresql_key" -L 15432:localhost:5432 ubuntu@40.233.74.182
-i: Specifies the private key for SSH authentication.

-L: Establishes a tunnel: local_port:remote_host:remote_port.

Confirmed tunnel was active locally:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 127.0.0.1 -Port 15432
# Result: TcpTestSucceeded : True
Connected using a PostgreSQL client with the following settings:

Setting	Value
Host	127.0.0.1
Port	15432
Username	(your PostgreSQL user)
Password	(your PostgreSQL password)
Database	(your database name)

‚úÖ Outcome
PostgreSQL is now securely accessible from the local machine through SSH tunneling without needing to expose port 5432 over the public internet.
