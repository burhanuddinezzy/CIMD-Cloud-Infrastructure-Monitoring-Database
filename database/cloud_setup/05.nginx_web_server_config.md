# Overview
Collecting application logs is crucial for a comprehensive Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring Database (CIMD), providing application-level insights beyond server metrics. To showcase this capability and my understanding of holistic monitoring essential for modern DevOps, I've installed Nginx and configured Telegraf to ingest its logs. This demonstrates my ability to gather vital data on application behavior, user interactions, and errors, offering a fuller picture of system health for effective troubleshooting and observability.
