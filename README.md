# Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring Database (CIMD)

**Manual Setup Notice**
**All infrastructure and database setup in this project was done manually, without relying on automation tools or templates. This was a deliberate choice to demonstrate my problem-solving, SQL, and system integration skills.**
**Screenshots and setup notes are included in manual_setup.md.**

## Overview

The **Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring Database (CIMD)** is a project aimed at enhancing cloud observability by integrating telemetry data, system logs, resource metrics, and historical incident records. The goal is to build a data-driven monitoring solution that provides insights into infrastructure health, performance trends, and potential system failures.

## Project Goals

- Develop a structured database for storing and analyzing cloud infrastructure telemetry data.
- Enable historical trend analysis to identify recurring patterns and potential failure points.
- Explore methods for correlating past incidents with current data to improve monitoring capabilities.
- Design a scalable and query-optimized database architecture for efficient data retrieval.
- Integrate multi-cloud and on-premise infrastructure monitoring into a unified system.

## Challenges & Motivation

Modern cloud environments generate vast amounts of data, making it difficult to extract actionable insights. Existing monitoring solutions primarily focus on real-time alerting but often lack predictive capabilities. By leveraging historical data and advanced correlation techniques, this project aims to move toward a more proactive monitoring approach.

## Key Focus Areas

- **Data Storage & Management**: Structuring and optimizing the database to handle telemetry data efficiently.
- **Historical Analysis**: Utilizing stored data to identify long-term trends and anomalies.
- **Multi-Cloud Integration**: Supporting data ingestion from multiple cloud providers.
- **Customizable Monitoring Metrics**: Allowing users to define key performance indicators and alerting thresholds.

## Technology Stack

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (hosted on Oracle Cloud's free-tier Autonomous Database)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Python (TBD)
- **Frontend**: React (for visualization dashboard)
- **Cloud Integration**: Support for AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and on-premise systems

## Next Steps

- Finalizing database schema and relationships between different telemetry data points.
- Implementing data ingestion pipelines for log and metric collection.
- Developing initial visualization dashboards for infrastructure monitoring.
- Exploring predictive analytics and anomaly detection models.

## Contributing

This is an evolving project. As the design and implementation progress, contributions and feedback are welcome to refine the database schema, improve monitoring features, and optimize performance.
